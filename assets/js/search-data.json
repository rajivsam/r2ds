    "content": "At the surface level, developing a data science solution for a business task is about breaking the functional task into known data science task primitives. There are a handful of data science task primitives (see (Provost &amp; Fawcett, 2013) for details), so this might seem like a simple task. Usually, a naive approach leads to uncovering hidden problems and pitfalls due to unverified modelling assumptions and sub-optimal models that are costly to develop and maintain. Though old, (Pyle, 1999) provides timeless advice and a very good summary of the tasks involved in a typical data science business project. Typically, there is a significant exploratory component in developing a data science model requiring dialogue with business stakeholders and modeling experimentation. To achieve success, the data science team must surface the right questions and model the right problem. This takes skill, experience and engineering judgment. The following quote from (Provost &amp; Fawcett, 2013) best summarizes this: . A critical skill in data science is the ability to decompose a data- analytics problem into pieces such that each piece matches a known task for which tools are available. Recognizing familiar problems and their solutions avoids wasting time and resources reinventing the wheel. It also allows people to focus attention on more interesting parts of the process that require human involvement—parts that have not been automated, so human creativity and intelligence must come in‐ to play. Start a conversation with me today to explore getting your data science based business idea to fruition.

    "content": "This site may give you a flavor of the the kind of problems I am interested in, but there is much to add and this is a work in progress. I spent a long time developing software for business tasks in various domains, and I have a strong interest in the intersection of data science and software engineering. I can work with your data science team on the following tasks: . | Applying data science to understand and extract insights from operational data. | Working with your data science team on framing business problems in terms of data science and machine learning. Translating business KPIs into model metrics and vice versa takes experience and practice. I have worked with data science teams in the past to help them with this translation. | Summarizing and visualizing data science results for business stakeholders. This again requires experience and practice. | Model and complexity management. What is the right level of model complexity for a given business problem? How do we refine and improve models over time? Doing this with a satisficing perspective takes experience and practice. | Summarizing your data assets to inform the problems that you are interested in solving. Organizations collect vast quantitites of data over time. Summarizing these data assets so that key insights make their way into model iterations is a continuos process. There have been many developments in this area in the past decade (see this playlist ). However, picking the right approach for your data assets and business problem is not trivial. I can help you with this. | Working with your optimization team on interfacing machine learning and statistical models with optimization models. This is a very interesting area of research and has gained traction in the past decade. Many optimization and planning problems are stochastic in nature. They have to take uncertainty into account. This uncertainty can be modeled with machine learning and statistical models. For example, the weather can be a stochastic variable in a planning problem. If you are an agricultural company, you may want to use machine learning models to predict the weather. You can then use these predictions in your optimization models. If you are a retailer with perishable goods, you may want to use machine learning models to predict demand. You can then use these predictions to plan your inventory. Stochastic optimization is not esoteric anymore, thanks to the quality of optimization tools that are available today. | . ",
