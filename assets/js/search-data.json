Typically, there is no learning component in an analytic use case. If you have a machine learning use case, the style of learning you want to adopt, offline or batch machine learning, is an important decision. When to redeploy a model and the kind of learning style that you want to adopt is a decision that is driven by business conditions, your budget, and lead times in your organization for model deployment.

The first step of the reference implementation is the select step. This step selects the subset of data that you provide to me that is relevant to the task1. The second step is the denoising step. For each attribute that is relevant, there is a set of admissible values for that attribute. What is admissible depends on the use case and the attribute. Admissible values of the attribute are what can be processed in the modeling or analytics computation. The set of inadmissible values for the attribute is called noise. How noise is processed, called, denoising depends on the use-case and the type of inadmissibility. Missing values can be one type of inadmissibility. Denoising produces a dataset that is ready for further processing. Once the data is denoised, each attribute in the resulting dataset has values that the model building or the analytics computation can process. Data Quality tools can be used to abstract away the notion of noise and attest to the quality of the dataset for modeling and analytics computation2. In order to perform the required modeling or analytics computation, we may need new attributes derived from the attributes in the raw dataset, or we may need to transform the raw attributes to a new form based on some preprocessing recipe. This happens in the transform step. At the end of the transform step, we have a dataset that is ready for modeling. What is done in the modeling step depends on the specifics of the use case.

    "content": "Business or organizational actions taken on the basis of a prediction from a machine learning model have business or organizational consequences. For example, in a Banking application, rejecting a loan applicant who turns out to be credit worthy results in lost revenue to the Bank. Approving a loan to a defaulter, could result in a bigger loss. Excessive security redirections in a business website could be a detractor to potential customers. Lax security measures could result in legal charges and financial losses. Making decisions based on costa associated with actions is a critical need. (Elkan, 2001) provides an excellent discussion of the basic concepts used in developing the theory around cost based decision making in machine learning applications. (Ling &amp; Sheng, 2008) is a more recent (still over ten years old as of this writing) treatment that surveys approaches to cost based decision making. A key characteristic of making decisions where cost is relevant using supervised learning is that such applications are usually associated with imbalanced datasets. Some classes of the target variable are under-represented in the dataset. To make this idea concrete, consider the binary classification setting. There are two classes, one of which is under-represented. This is called the minority class. By contrast, the over-represented class is called the majority class. This discussion follows the convention used in (Elkan, 2001). The minority class is associated with the \\(1\\) label and the majority class is associated with the \\(0\\) label. In a balanced dataset, the prior probablity of the \\(0\\) and the \\(1\\) class is \\(0.5\\). A key idea used in solving the imbalance issue is to construct a balanced data set out of the original imbalanced dataset using sampling. (Elkan, 2001) develops a theory that explains how we can create a balanced dataset out of an imbalanced dataset on the basis of costs associated with classifying an example with a particular target value (\\(0\\) or \\(1\\)). (Hart, 1968) uses an idea based on developing a balanced dataset from the imbalanced data set by preserving the neighborhood of each minority class instance to be consistent with the neighborhood of the point in imbalanced raw dataset. See this video link for more details on the idea. This principle is used developing the solution. This choice was made because (Elkan, 2001) provides the rationale to undersample the minority class but does not prescribe how to achieve it (fair enough). Random undersampling of the majority class can change the decision boundary that manifests in the original imbalanced dataset. Condensed nearest neighbors is attractive because it preserves the decision boundary associated with problem. It should be noted that the probabilities predicated by the model developed on the data may still be noisy. Probability caliberation can be applied to correct noise. This will be addressed in a separate algorithmic recipe shortly. ",

    "content": "Feature engineering can be very useful in datasets with class imbalance. This turned out to be the case for the example used to illustrate the learning with costs algorithm. The example uses real world data published by the Small Business Adminsitration (SBA). It provides details about the loan repayment history for businesses it assists. Loan defaults and cancellations do occur, though most loans are paid in full. Predicting loan defaults is an established application in the finance domain. Location is important in real estate. It turned out to be pivot for feature engineering done with this dataset. Exploratory data analysis revealed that defaults occur only a specific set of zip codes. By creating a derived attribute that captures if a zip code associated with a loan falls witin this “bad” set of zip codes, we can compute a very effective loan quality model. Using just the raw features can lead you to models with poor performance. This underscores the value of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and due dilligence in developing data science solutions. The solutions using the approach by (Elkan, 2001) and (Hart, 1968) provide similar results. The imbalanced-learn library was used for the reference implementation. In this recipe, the condensed nearest neighbor approach is used for constructing the balanced dataset, other approaches are also possible, see imbalanced-learn for more details. ",

A review of the notebook will show that inventory item demand for a particular time period has a long tail distribution. A small handful of store inventory accounts for must of the business at the store. This could be used by store managers for inventory planning and pricing applications. An example of applying this recipe to compute the load on different support groups in a help desk application is available here. This information can be useful to understand the workload for the support groups for a particular period of time.
