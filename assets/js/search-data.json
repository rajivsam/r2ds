    "content": "Data science has a lot of value to offer to businesses if applied correctly. This aspect of data science is similar to developing great software. Sure great software needs good code, but to be useful, it needs to implement the right features with the right user experience. With the current hype around AI, it is quite easy to do what everybody does and ask an agent to implement your solution for you. AI assistants are great as assistants, to generate code, but solving the right problem is still a human task. The AI agent can help you with the code, but it cannot help you with how to frame the problem correctly. This requires a human with the right experience and skill set. Data science solutions are developed iteratively, the right skill set and experience can vastly improve the number of iterations it takes to get to a solution that is useful. I have been developing driven software solutions for over 25 years, and I have developed a set of skills that can help you get to a solution that is useful for your business. If you’re ready to bring your data science-driven business idea to life, schedule a conversation with me today. For an overview of my approach, visit the process section.

I believe that every problem is unique, and therefore requires a tailored solution. If we agree to work together, I will work with you develop an iteration plan that gets us to a solution that is useful for your business.

Effectively framing a business challenge as a data science problem requires experience, careful analysis, and close collaboration. Automated or “cookbook” approaches often fall short, leading to models that are difficult to interpret or deploy in production. I can partner with your team to guide the initial iterations of your machine learning or optimization initiatives—helping you identify the most relevant data sources, select suitable modeling techniques, and ensure that results are both interpretable and actionable. This approach increases the likelihood of building solutions that deliver real business value and are ready for operational use. | . ",
