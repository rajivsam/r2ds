    "content": "At its core, developing a data science solution for a business challenge involves breaking down the functional task into well-established data science task primitives. While there are only a few such primitives (see (Provost &amp; Fawcett, 2013) for details), this process is rarely straightforward. A naive approach often exposes hidden challenges, such as unverified modeling assumptions or suboptimal models that are expensive to build and maintain. (Pyle, 1999), though dated, offers timeless guidance and a comprehensive overview of the tasks involved in a typical data science project. Creating a successful data science model often requires significant exploration, including collaboration with business stakeholders and iterative modeling experiments. Success hinges on the ability of the data science team to ask the right questions and frame the problem correctly. This demands skill, experience, and sound engineering judgment. (Provost &amp; Fawcett, 2013) encapsulates this idea succinctly: . A critical skill in data science is the ability to decompose a data- analytics problem into pieces such that each piece matches a known task for which tools are available. Recognizing familiar problems and their solutions avoids wasting time and resources reinventing the wheel. It also allows people to focus attention on more interesting parts of the process that require human involvement—parts that have not been automated, so human creativity and intelligence must come in‐ to play.

    "content": "This site may give you a flavor of the the kind of problems I am interested in, but there is much to add and this is a work in progress. I spent a long time developing software for business tasks in various domains, and I have a strong interest in the intersection of data science and software engineering. I can work with your data science team on the following tasks: . | Leveraging data science to extract actionable insights from operational data. This encompasses a wide range of activities, from exploratory data analysis to developing machine learning models using data from operational systems or analytics platforms. Typical challenges I can help address include: . | Predicting customer behaviors such as churn, demand, or product returns | Monitoring key behaviors, actions, or performance metrics | Building descriptive models for customer or process segmentation | Creating prescriptive models that recommend actions to prevent negative outcomes or improve the likelihood of success—for example, optimizing help desk ticket triage | . | . For practical examples, see this blog. | Collaborating with your data science team to frame business challenges as data science and machine learning problems. Effectively translating business KPIs into actionable model metrics—and interpreting model results in business terms—requires both technical expertise and domain understanding. I have experience guiding teams through this process, ensuring alignment between business objectives and data-driven solutions. For practical examples, see this GitHub repository and the associated tool. For a representative publication, refer to this article. | . | Translating complex data science results into clear, actionable insights for business stakeholders. Effectively summarizing and visualizing operational data is essential for decision-making, but can be challenging due to the sheer volume and complexity of information. By leveraging machine learning and data mining techniques, it’s possible to uncover patterns and highlight factors associated with both positive and negative outcomes—often revealing issues that may not be apparent through traditional, expert-driven analysis alone. Combining these data-driven approaches with domain expertise ensures that findings are both relevant and actionable. I can assist in designing and implementing solutions that bridge the gap between technical results and business understanding. | . | Managing model complexity and evolution. Determining the appropriate level of complexity for a model is crucial to solving business problems effectively—overly simple models may miss important patterns, while overly complex ones can be difficult to interpret and maintain. I can help assess and refine models over time, balancing accuracy, interpretability, and maintainability. Adopting a satisficing approach ensures that models are “good enough” for the task at hand, without unnecessary complication. For an example of this work, see this publication. | . | Summarizing and profiling your data assets to guide problem-solving. Organizations accumulate large volumes of data, but extracting meaningful insights requires systematic exploration and summarization. This ongoing process ensures that valuable information is incorporated into each iteration of your models. Recent advances in data profiling and summarization techniques (see this playlist) offer new ways to surface actionable insights. I can help you select and apply the most suitable methods for your specific data assets and business objectives. | . | Collaborating with your optimization team to integrate machine learning and statistical models with optimization workflows. Many real-world planning and decision problems involve uncertainty—such as unpredictable demand, weather, or supply disruptions. Machine learning models can quantify this uncertainty by generating forecasts or probability distributions, which can then be incorporated into optimization models to improve planning and resource allocation. For example, agricultural businesses can use weather prediction models to inform crop planning, while retailers can leverage demand forecasts to optimize inventory for perishable goods. Advances in optimization tools have made it increasingly practical to embed data-driven predictions into stochastic optimization frameworks, enabling more robust and adaptive decision-making. | . ",
